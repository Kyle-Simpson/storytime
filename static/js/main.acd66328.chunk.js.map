Since then, I have found one such job at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (<a href=\"http://healthdata.org\" target=\"_blank\">IHME</a>) as a data analyst\n                      / research consultant.\n                </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    In my role I work on a team called Surge that functions a lot like special ops. The mission is always to join a team,\n                    learn the information that is necessary for exactly what I’m doing, execute, and then switch teams - usually all within the span\n                    of 3 weeks.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    You can imagine that this isn’t the most relaxing first job.

Will\n                    policymakers all over the world feel confident enough in our results to utilize them, or will they go in one ear and out the other?\n                    Real casual work conditions ya know?\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    In the three months I’ve been at IHME, the learning curve has been immense.  After a basic, three-day orientation\n                    I was immediately thrown into my first assignment where I was greeted by a room of the world's leading Health Economists and\n                    I was supposed to be the expert on a programming language I had never heard of.  On my seventh day on the\n                    job I was asked to implement a Spatiotemporal Gaussian Process Regression (ST-GPR) model on a 900,000 row by 56 column data set\n                    received directly from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, still in that programming language I was only starting to understand.\n                    “Yikes” was my first response to that request.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    All of this in mind, the benefits of my job far outweigh the risks.  I get to work alongside wickedly intelligent individuals who\n                    care about doing cutting edge science that spearheads the world’s understanding of the global burden of disease.  My colleagues are\n                    hyper-nerds with social skills and a purpose.  And I was offered a seat at the table.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    In the weeks since my first day, the work hasn’t even come close to slowing down but my tolerance and efficiency have drastically\n                    increased.  The pace of work during undergrad is meager in comparison, but the difference now is that the work is impactful and\n                    stays at the office in Belltown.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    For time’s sake this is as much of a story as you get about my new job, and for good reason.  I have two more good stories to share\n                    before you go.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n          </Col>\n\n\n        </div>\n\n        <hr></hr>\n\n        <div className=\"activities\">\n          <a id=\"activities\"><Fade bottom><h2>So Much Room for Activities</h2></Fade></a>\n          <Col>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    In my opinion, the city of Seattle has the best public parks of any city on the West Coast.  They’re well kept, completely free,\n                    and incredibly Instagram worthy.  I’ve spent the last four years learning about and exploring as many as I feasibly could, and there\n                    has always been one that stands out as a clear favorite of mine.\n                </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText className=\"middle\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Green+Lake,+Seattle,+WA/@47.6708043,-122.357081,13.27z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x54901414dad562fd:0xc942aafc8f01267c!8m2!3d47.6798344!4d-122.3257819\" target=\"_blank\">Greenlake</a>\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    For some context, the lake at the center of the Greenlake neighborhood was carved by a glacier about 50,000 years ago and is now\n                    outlined by a 2.8 mile path (4.5km for the metric squad).  The lake is currently an average of 13ft deep and 30ft deep at maximum,\n                    but if you had been in Seattle prior to 1911 it would have been an additional 7ft deep and stretched all the way to the edge of\n                    Ravenna Park (another Seattle classic).  I count the time I have spent at Greenlake and in the Greenlake neighborhood as some of the\n                    most valuable I have spent in Seattle, partially because of the community that Greenlake fosters.  All of the information I now\n                    know about Greenlake (including the information above) I learned from a series of conversations with hipster baristas, elderly\n                    members of a Tai Chi group, professional speed skaters, and homeless fishermen, all of whom call the Greenlake area their home.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    For a few years now I have also dreamed of calling Greenlake my home, and as of September I do.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    There were a few factors that were really important to me while I was apartment hunting: public transit options, distance to a\n                    grocery store, and being in a space that promoted good mental health practices.  The first two factors are easy to assess from an\n                    apartment listing, but the third one is tricky to put your finger on, even in person.  At most of the apartments I toured I had to\n                    make sacrifices on at least one of those three factors.  Did I want a 15 minute walk to a bus or a 20 minute walk to the closest QFC?\n                    Did I want to be close to my friends, or did I want to live somewhere with more than 175 square feet of living space?  There were\n                    some buildings where I considered compromising, but in August I stumbled upon one that I didn’t have to compromise on at all.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    At my new apartment, walking, I live 2 minutes from the bus that currently takes me to work, 4 minutes from the bus that will take\n                    me to work starting in June, 3 minutes from two of my favorite coffee shops in Seattle (Retreat and Revolutions), 5 minutes from a\n                    grocery store, and ONE WHOLE MINUTE from Greenlake park.  When I say that I nailed it with this one, I f***ing mean it.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    What’s the space like, you ask?  Let me tell you.  The unit is a top-floor, one bedroom / one bathroom, 700 sq.ft. apartment (so\n                    much room for activities!!) with a great kitchen in an adorable mid-century building.  And the absolute best part?  I can still\n                    afford it working my non-tech industry, global health, research job.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    In classic Kyle fashion I am going for a minimalist aesthetic throughout the unit.  A table and chairs, two couches that face each\n                    other, art prints from some of my favorite Seattle and Austin-based artists and designers, and some room for a yoga mat and bike\n                    stand.  I refuse to bring a TV into the apartment, so everything is thoughtfully configured to invite conversation.  And of course\n                    my signature twinkle lights tracing the corners of the ceiling.\n                  </CardText>\n                </CardBody>\n              </Card>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade bottom>\n              <Card style={{ \"padding-top\": \"5%\", \"padding-bottom\": \"5%\" }}>\n                <CardBody>\n                  <CardText>\n                    Though this section of my story is coming to a close for now, the adventures I’ll have in Greenlake are far from over.
